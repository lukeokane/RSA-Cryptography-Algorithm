# Introduction
RSA is a public key cryptographic algorithm designed for encrypting and decrypting messages. This project received a First Class Honors grade (1:1)

The implementation in this project is designed for a user to input their own messages and send them to another entity to read the message.

## Brief explanation
- Entity creates public and private keys
- User retrieves the public key
- User enters message, encrypts it with public key and sends to server
- Entity receives message and decrypts using private key.
